== Changelog ==

= 2.1.0 - 2013/03/22 =
* Feature: Newly developed mysql command that makes the Predictive Search Engine results 100% accurate, 100% of the time. Install this upgrade and try it out for yourself - you will be absolutely amazed, excited, over the moon like we are about it.
* Fixed: Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing search results to show a -1 in the drop down instead of the results because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Predictive Search now automatically detects that and works as it should.
* Tweak: Jumped version from 2.0.2 to 2.1.0 with the release of the Predictive Search engine 100% accurate results upgrade. 


= 2.0.2 - 2013/03/15 =
* Feature: All Results search page shortcode now shows as an image in the Search results page Visual text editor instead of the shortcode [woocommerce_search]. We have used an image to overcome some confusion about if the shortcode was a3rev Predictive Search or a WooCommerce shortcode function. Also has instructions (in English) about moving the shortcode to another page. After you upgrade, take a look


= 2.0.1 - 2013/03/13 =
* Fixed : Can't activate the plugin on some sites . The problem was in php configuration differences .It was caused by php configuration related to short <?php syntax which allows to use <? instead. Thanks to WordPress member Ovidiu for firstly reporting this then giving us ftp and wp-admin access to see and find the problem on his server.


= 2.0 - 2013/02/28 =
* Feature: Updated all plugin code to be WooCommerce V2.0 compatible with backward compatibility.

* Feature: Added the ability to add text content that shows inside the Search box. Added as a Global setting or can be individually set on each Widget

* Fixed: Undefined variable mediumSRC notice showing in search box dropdown when product does not have a featured image.We fixed by defining the variable.
* Tweak: Jumped version to 2.0 to keep in synch with the Pro Version.


= 1.0.8 - 2013/01/08 =

* Feature: Added get Product Name results character description from Products 'short description' if no content is entered for Product description.

= 1.0.6 - 2012/11/27 =

* Fixed: Version 1.0.4 fix where we removed Predictive Search filter 'posts_search' from single product page edit page to fix the Cross sells and Upsells search caused the Products search filter to be corrupted because we use Wordpress ajax to show results in the widget drop down. The ajax is called from admin-ajax.php file in admin so it also did not add the filter and show incorrect results.
* Feature: Added exclude individual Products from Predictive Search. From the WooCommerce > Settings > Predictive Search tab enter the Product custom post ID of any products that you do not want included in Predictive Search results.
* Feature: Added Exclude all search types to the admin panel. Exclude Product category, Product tag, Posts and pages is a Pro version feature but this keeps up the code compatibility between the Pro and Lite versions for seamless upgrades.
