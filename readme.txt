In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9. There are a number of functions in jQuery Version 1.9 that have been depreciated and hence this was causing errors with the jQuery function in the plugin.

= 2.1.2 - 2013/04/12 =
* Fix - Link from search box drop down footer to All Results Search pages not working in Internet Explorer 8, 9 and 10.

* Tweak - Jumped version from 2.0.2 to 2.1.0 with the release of the Predictive Search engine 100% accurate results upgrade.
* Fix - Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing search results to show a -1 in the drop down instead of the results because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Predictive Search now automatically detects that and works as it should.

= 2.0.2 - 2013/03/15 =
* Feature - All Results search page shortcode now shows as an image in the Search results page Visual text editor instead of the shortcode [woocommerce_search]. We have used an image to overcome some confusion about if the shortcode was a3rev Predictive Search or a WooCommerce shortcode function. Also has instructions (in English) about moving the shortcode to another page. After you upgrade, take a look

= 2.0.1 - 2013/03/13 =
* Fix - Can't activate the plugin on some sites . The problem was in php configuration differences .It was caused by php configuration related to short <?php syntax which allows to use <? instead.

* Tweak - Added get Product Name results character description from Products 'short description' if no content is entered for Product description.

If the theme post_type is array plugin will now use function is_array() and in_array() instead of trim() function to generate the All Search Results pages. Thanks to Dietmar Hohn of Germany for working with us on this quirky bug fix.

* Credit -Thanks to Jason Flemming for alerting us to this issue.

= 1.0.5 - 2012/11/22 =
* Feature - Added exclude individual Products from Predictive Search. From the WooCommerce > Settings > Predictive Search tab enter the Product custom post ID of any products that you do not want included in Predictive Search results.
* Feature - Added Exclude all search types to the admin panel. Exclude Product category, Product tag, Posts and pages is a Pro version feature but this keeps up the code compatibility between the Pro and Lite versions for seamless upgrades.
* Tweak - Change to admin panel for Predictive Search Function to keep the Lite and Pro Versions in sync for seamless upgrade - Pro Version Search function for replacing WordPress / WooCommerce or Theme Search functions in theme header has been upgraded to allow for easier global function configuration. Go to the WooCommerce > Settings > Predictive Search and you will see that with the Pro Version you can now add and update the function search values on that page. Once values are added and the page updated Pro version license holders can just add the global function to their header.php file.
* Tweak - Added link on admin panel to our latest WooCommerce Lite Version plugin - WooCommerce Widget Product Slideshow.
* Fix - Version 1.0.4 fix where we removed Predictive Search filter 'posts_search' from single product page edit page to fix the Cross sells and Upsells search caused the Products search filter to be corrupted because we use Wordpress ajax to show results in the widget drop down. The ajax is called from admin-ajax.php file in admin so it also did not add the filter and show incorrect results.

= 1.0.4 - 2012/11/16 =
* Tweak - Added link to our latest WooCommerce plugin - WooCommerce Widget Product Slideshow to the list of available A3 WooCommerce plugins on the Predictive Search admin tab.
* Fix - Removed Predictive Search filter 'posts_search' from single product page edit page. The filter was causing the 'Related Products' Up-Sells and Cross-Sells 'Search for a Product' in the WooCommerce meta not to work at times on both the Lite version and the Pro version.

= 1.0.3 - 2012/09/25 =
* Feature - Automated the All Results Search page endless scroll feature. No longer have to click the bar to see more results.
* Tweak - Edited widget, shortcode pop up and function to show Pro Version new Search by Product SKU feature
* Tweak - Edited admin page to show new Pro Version add to cart feature on All Search Results page.
* Tweak - Updated readme for WordPress description text.

= 1.0.2 - 2012/09/14 =
* Feature - Activated the ability in Lite version to set the number of search results that show in the widget search box dropdown.
* Feature - Activated the ability in Lite version to set the number of description characters that show in the widget search box dropdown.
* Tweak - Added Documentation and Support Links to plugins description.

* Tweak - Added screenshots to the wordpress.org listing.
* Tweak - Updated Predictive Search WooCommerce Tab with links to other A3 WooCommerce plugins on wordpress.org for ease of navigation.
* Tweak - UI changes to Widget to accommodate the new Pro Major Update features.

= 1.0.1 - 2012/08/03 =
* Feature - Show first thumb image in product gallery if the product does not have feature image.
* Tweak - Hide the description when enter 0 as the number of description characters in the sidebar widget and Admin panel.
* Fix - Show the 6 results with 100 characters of product description by default when no value is present in Widget control and Admin panel
* Fix - Change z-index for search box from 1001 to 99 so that themes nav bar dropdowns slide over it instead of behind the search box

= 1.0.0 - 2012/08/01 =
* Initial release.
