= 2.1.3 - 2013/04/15 =
* Fix - Updated all Javascript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9. There are a number of functions in jQuery Version 1.9 that have been depreciated and hence this was causing errors with the jQuery function in the plugin.

= 2.1.2 - 2013/04/12 =
* Fix - Link from search box drop down footer to All Results Search pages not working in Internet Explorer 8, 9 and 10.

* Tweak - Jumped version from 2.0.2 to 2.1.0 with the release of the Predictive Search engine 100% accurate results upgrade.
* Fix - Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing search results to show a -1 in the drop down instead of the results because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Predictive Search now automatically detects that and works as it should.

= 2.0.2 - 2013/03/15 =
* Feature - All Results search page shortcode now shows as an image in the Search results page Visual text editor instead of the shortcode [woocommerce_search]. We have used an image to overcome some confusion about if the shortcode was a3rev Predictive Search or a WooCommerce shortcode function. Also has instructions (in English) about moving the shortcode to another page. After you upgrade, take a look

= 2.0.1 - 2013/03/13 =
* Fix - Can't activate the plugin on some sites . The problem was in php configuration differences .It was caused by php configuration related to short <?php syntax which allows to use <? instead. Thanks to WordPress member Ovidiu for firstly reporting this then giving us ftp and wp-admin access to see and find the problem on his server.

= 2.0 - 2013/02/28 =

* Feature - Added the ability to add text content that shows inside the Search box. Added as a Global setting or can be individually set on each Widget

* Tweak - Updated all plugin code to be WooCommerce V2.0 compatible with backward compatibility.
* Tweak - Jumped version to 2.0 to keep in synch with the Pro Version.
* Fixed - Undefined variable mediumSRC notice showing in search box dropdown when product does not have a featured image.We fixed by defining the variable.

= 1.0.8 - 2013/01/08 =
* Tweak - Updated Support and Pro Version link URL's on wordpress.org description, plugins and plugins dashboard. Links were returning 404 errors since the launch of the all new a3rev.com mobile responsive site as the base e-commerce permalinks is changed.

= 1.0.7 - 2012/12/18 =
* Tweak - Added get Product Name results character description from Products 'short description' if no content is entered for Product description.
* Fix - Plugin now supports themes that use post_type array rather than post_type string. If the theme post_type is array plugin will now use function is_array() and in_array() instead of trim() function to generate the All Search Results pages. Thanks to Dietmar Hohn of Germany for working with us on this quirky bug fix.

= 1.0.6 - 2012/11/27 =

* Feature - Added exclude individual Products from Predictive Search. From the WooCommerce > Settings > Predictive Search tab enter the Product custom post ID of any products that you do not want included in Predictive Search results.
* Feature - Added Exclude all search types to the admin panel. Exclude Product category, Product tag, Posts and pages is a Pro version feature but this keeps up the code compatibility between the Pro and Lite versions for seamless upgrades.
* Tweak - Change to admin panel for Predictive Search Function to keep the Lite and Pro Versions in sync for seamless upgrade - Pro Version Search function for replacing WordPress / WooCommerce or Theme Search functions in theme header has been upgraded to allow for easier global function configuration. Go to the WooCommerce > Settings > Predictive Search and you will see that with the Pro Version you can now add and update the function search values on that page. Once values are added and the page updated Pro version license holders can just add the global function to their header.php file.
* Tweak - Added link on admin panel to our latest WooCommerce Lite Version plugin - WooCommerce Widget Product Slideshow.
* Fix - Version 1.0.4 fix where we removed Predictive Search filter 'posts_search' from single product page edit page to fix the Cross sells and Upsells search caused the Products search filter to be corrupted because we use Wordpress ajax to show results in the widget drop down. The ajax is called from admin-ajax.php file in admin so it also did not add the filter and show incorrect results.

= 1.0.4 - 2012/11/16 =
* Tweak - Added link to our latest WooCommerce plugin - WooCommerce Widget Product Slideshow to the list of available A3 WooCommerce plugins on the Predictive Search admin tab.
